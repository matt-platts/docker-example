A very simple battleships game, that I wrote as part of a job interview once, in an afternoon.

Usage:

Fire up index.html in a web browser to play
For the backdoor cheat, go to battleships.php?action=show in a browser and do view_source to format it correctly
Or on the main page in the browser, simply add ?show = 1 to the url

Notes:

Config file allows values for x and y to specify how big the grid is, and the ships are also set in here as well by their lengths.


What I'd still like to do (given more time):

 - Specify the ships as types in the config. Eg. Battleship = 5, Destroyer = 4 etc and identify them in the front end.
 - The back end runs dynamically off the config file (grid size, quty and size of ships) but the the front end does not currently.
 - Continuously generating random co-ordinates if there is a collision is potentially wasteful and although the chance is minute, could
    technically keep re-generating the same co-ordinates or collision co-ordinates over and over! I started repositioning any colliding
    ships and called the function recusrively to regenerate the ship if that didn't work quickly, but would ideally like to keep shifting it
    to get a closest possible position.
